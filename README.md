# BlondeChip-8

**Blondechip-8** is my personal project aimed at building a CHIP-8 emulator using the Go programming language. As an aspiring developer eager to delve into the world of emulation, I chose to start with CHIP-8 due to its simplicity and suitability as a learning tool. Additionally, my interest in learning Go led me to undertake this project in the language. The name "Blondechip-8" is a playful homage to my enjoyment of Frank Ocean's album _Blond_, which serves as the soundtrack to my coding sessions.

## Introduction

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language used on vintage computers like the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800. Its straightforward instruction set makes it an ideal starting point for emulator development.

## Why Blondechip-8?

- **Learning Emulation:** Blondechip-8 provides me with a hands-on opportunity to explore the intricacies of emulation, from memory management to CPU emulation, while working on a project that aligns with my interests.
- **Exploring Go:** Building the emulator in Go allows me to familiarize myself with the language's syntax, features, and performance characteristics in a practical context.
- **Musical Inspiration:** The name "Blondechip-8" reflects my admiration for Frank Ocean's album _Blond_ and serves as a reminder of the creative inspiration that fuels my coding journey.

## Features

- **CHIP-8 Emulation:** Blondechip-8 faithfully replicates the behavior of a CHIP-8 interpreter, enabling users to run classic CHIP-8 games and programs.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Being written in Go, Blondechip-8 is platform-independent, ensuring that it can run seamlessly on various operating systems.
